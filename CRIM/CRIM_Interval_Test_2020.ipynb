The **number** in this command represents the **minimum number of matching melodies needed before reporting**. This allows us to filter for common or uncommon soggetti.\n","- **Close** matches allow for melodic variation (see more below). `find_close_matches(patterns, 2, 1)`\n",". The **first number** in this command is the minimum number of melodies needed before reporting; the **second number** is threshold needed in order to find a match. Lower number = very similar; higher number = less similar\n","\n","### More about Close Matches  \n","- The **threshold for close matches** is determined by the third number called in the method. We select two patterns, then compare *each vector in each pattern successively*. The \"differences\" between each vector are summed. If that value is below the threshold specified, we consider the two patterns closely matched.\n","- The format of the method call is  `find_close_matches(the array you get from into_patterns, minimum matches needed to be displayed, threshold for close match)`.\n","\n","### About Rhythmic Durations\n","\n","- For `find_close_matches` and `find_exact_matches`, rhythmic variation/duration is displayed, but **not** factored into the calculation of matching.\n","- **Incremental Offset** calculates the intervals using a fixed offset between notes, no matter their actual duration.  Use this to ignore passing tones or other ornaments.  The offsets are expressed in multiples of the quarter note (Offset = 1 samples at quarter note; Offset = 2 at half note, etc). Set with `vectors = IntervalBase(corpus.note_list_incremental_offset(2))`\n","\n","### Dataframe Preview vs Full Results in Browser\n","\n","- Comment out the first of these for preview only.  Include for full results\n","\n","    - `#pd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", None, \"display.max_columns\", None)`\n","    - `return pd.DataFrame(match_data)`\n","    \n","### To Set CSV Output\n","\n","- Specify file name here `pd.Series(match_data).to_csv(\"Match_data_10_13.csv\")`\n","\n","***"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SIo3MIjN7tW2"},"source":["# Testing CRIM Intervals with Ave Maria Soggetti and Patterns\n","These tests demonstrate the how the CRIM Intervals system produces \"matches\" in various contexts:\n","\n","**Exact Matches** (in all respects--melodic and rhythmic)\n","**Close Matches** (via tranposition, substitution of pitches and durations, ornamentation, and differences in overall length)\n","The CRIM intervals __[test file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DoXHAzj_QxLS7sFyyoqXOPUwYer4rKi6/view?usp=sharing)__ is the basis of our work.\n","It features a few basic soggetti, each heard in four different voices.
