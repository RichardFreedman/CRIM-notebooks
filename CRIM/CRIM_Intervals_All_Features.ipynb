    "# About Crim Intervals \n",
    "\n",
    "- See more at https://github.com/HCDigitalScholarship/intervals/blob/master/README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Select Pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "- For local file(s), use: `corpus = CorpusBase(['/Users/rfreedma/MEI/CRIM_Intervals_Tests/Brumel_Complete.mei'])`\n",
    "- For remote file, use: `corpus = CorpusBase(['https://crimproject.org/mei/CRIM_Model_0008.mei', 'https://crimproject.org/mei/CRIM_Mass_0005_5.mei'])`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes about the Various Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Length of the Soggetto**: into_patterns([vectors.semitone_intervals], 5) The **number** in this command represents the **minimum number of vectors to find**. 5 vectors is 6 notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chromatic vs Diatonic \n",
    "- **Chromatic** uses `into_patterns([vectors.semitone_intervals], 5)`\n",
    "- **Diatonic** uses `into_patterns([vectors.generic_intervals], 5)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exact vs Close  \n",
    "- **Exact** is exact in *all* ways find_exact_matches(patterns, 2). The **number** in this command represents the **minimum number of matching melodies needed before reporting**. This allows us to filter for common or uncommon soggetti.\n",
    "- **Close** matches allow for melodic variation (see more below). `find_close_matches(patterns, 2, 1)`\n",
    ". The **first number** in this command is the minimum number of melodies needed before reporting; the **second number** is threshold needed in order to find a match. Lower number = very similar; higher number = less similar\n",
    "\n",
    "### More about Close Matches  \n",
    "- The **threshold for close matches** is determined by the third number called in the method. We select two patterns, then compare *each vector in each pattern successively*. The \"differences\" between each vector are summed. If that value is below the threshold specified, we consider the two patterns closely matched.\n",
    "- The format of the method call is  `find_close_matches(the array you get from into_patterns, minimum matches needed to be displayed, threshold for close match)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Rhythmic Durations\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `find_close_matches` and `find_exact_matches`, rhythmic variation/duration is displayed, but **not** factored into the calculation of matching.\n",
    "- **Incremental Offset** calculates the intervals using a fixed offset between notes, no matter their actual duration.  Use this to ignore passing tones or other ornaments.  The offsets are expressed in multiples of the quarter note (Offset = 1 samples at quarter note; Offset = 2 at half note, etc). Set with `vectors = IntervalBase(corpus.note_list_incremental_offset(2))`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataframe Preview vs Full Results in Browser\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comment out the first of these for preview only.  Include for full results\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `#pd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", None, \"display.max_columns\", None)`\n",
    "    - `return pd.DataFrame(match_data)`\n",
    "    \n",
    "### To Set CSV Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specify file name here `pd.Series(match_data).to_csv(\"Match_data_10_13.csv\")`\n",
